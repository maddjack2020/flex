 interfere with user code. I particular, we are looking

 This file defines FlexLexer, an abstract class which specifies the
 external interface provided to flex C++ lexer objects, and yyFlexLexer,
 which defines a particular lexer class.
 .
 If you want to create multiple lexer classes, you use the -P flag
 to rename each yyFlexLexer to some other xxFlexLexer.  You then
 include <FlexLexer.h> in your other sources once per lexer class:
 .
 #undef yyFlexLexer
 #define yyFlexLexer xxFlexLexer
 #include <FlexLexer.h>
 .
 #undef yyFlexLexer
 #define yyFlexLexer zzFlexLexer
 #include <FlexLexer.h>

 As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
 part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
 parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
 as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
 the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
 special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
 Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
 License without this special exception.

 This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
 version 2.2 of Bison.
